# WatchRasPiTempOnWebsiteInRealtime
Watch some Raspberry Pi CPU temperature on local website in realtime.
This group of codes was created for use in a seminar report when I was a senior at a technical college.
First time used Node.js, Socket.io, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It really takes time to understand when you are new. When I look back on it afterwards, it's not much of a project. After all the hard work, the result is not even close to the many sites that are open to the world. It's sad. But this is just the first step, also don't worry about it. Even if the first step is not a big one, the next step should be a big one. so...Even a small step is fine. If you keep going, you may be surprised at so far you have come when you look back. Maybe, maybe not... Well, that's just the way my life is anyway. I don't hopes up. I'm not going to be a great person anyway, so I'll just keep going, little by little.

I swear, I will never stop, no matter what. Allen Walker from the comic "D.Gray-man
